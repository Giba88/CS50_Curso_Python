                    The UK is moving to electric cars in 2019, slowly but surely: Brits bought nearly 60,000 plug-in cars last year and the next two years will see the trickle of battery vehicles turn into a flood, – as prices reduce to become more competitive with petrol and diesel cars. Drivers are increasingly looking to ditch fossil fuels, but which electric vehicle (EV) should you buy? And is an electric car right for you in the first place?
                    From the latest Jaguar i-Pace, Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S to forthcoming electric SUV rivals the Audi E-tron, Mercedes-Benz EQ C and Tesla Model 3 launching this year, EVs are proving ever more popular with the public and car makers alike.                    
                    Sales of electrified cars in the UK rose 21% in 2018 and automotive researchers at Sophus3 concluded that electric cars are now the fourth most searched-for category online. In this handy guide, we talk you through CAR magazine’s pick of the best EVs that you can buy now in 2019.
