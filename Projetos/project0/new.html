                                Go was released by Google in 2009 with the aim of managing coding issues that large organizations face on a daily basis. Easy-to-use, simplicity, concurrency features, and performance are the main reasons why developers are happy with Go. In 2016, it was awarded the TIOBE programming language of the year.

                                The R programming language is not new, but it has become more popular in recent years, thanks to the big data revolution. It first appeared back in 1993, and now it is widely used among data miners and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software. It comes with both command line interface as well as graphical front-end.

                                    Groovy is an object-oriented scripting language, first appeared in 2003, but the stable release came out in 2007. Since it is dynamically compiled to Java bytecode, it seamlessly integrates with any Java library. So if you have programmed in Java or any other code that uses the curly bracket syntax, you can learn Groovy quickly.
